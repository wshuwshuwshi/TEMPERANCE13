This is where the magic happens, baby.

These are meant to be used when you walk onto a thingy that flashes you with one of these.
Naturally it also contains the part that contains the loreblurbs you've actually seen already in your human mob.
Just because it'd get a LITTLE annoying if you kept seeing this over and over. Haha.
